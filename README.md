This repo deals with the connection between Unity and NodeJs server using SocketIO. SocketIO creats a TCP connection between Unity build and NodeJs server which allows to and fro connections for message passing. 

This repo includes a nodeJs chat server with web build of HTML5 and CSS3 which will run on browser.

To start NodeJs server start with command in root directory
> npm install
> npm run server

Then open web browser with url:
> localhost:3000

A webpage will open. Which means your server is working

Now, open socket for in Unity and run.
